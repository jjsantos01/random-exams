# Description

This project is a public website available at https://jjsantos01.github.io/random-exams that allows to load an Excel file containing questions and options, generates a random exam for each student, and creates a PDF file with the exams and another PDF file with the correct answers.

You need to provide an Excel file with the following structure:

| Question 1 | option 1 (answer) | option 2 | option 3 | option 4 |
|------------|------------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Question 2 | option 1 (answer) | option 2 | option 3 | option 4 |
| Question 3 | option 1 (answer) | option 2 | option 3 | option 4 |
...

The first column contains the questions, and the other columns contain the options. The correct answer should be always the first option.
